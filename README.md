# Overview
The Transaction program is defined to stimulate the processing of transactions within a relational database. It utilizes a Hashmap to achieve a key, value connection between the person (String) and the dollar amount (Integer) of the ongoing transaction. 

## Installation
The existing repo is self-contained and doesn't require any dependencies. However, it is assumed that git and Java are already present on the user's system.

Use git to install the Trans-support program
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ja-smile/Trans-support.git
```

## Usage
Using any IDE, open the project folder (./src).
To run the program, run the Main.java file.
The output should be as follows:

## Future Modifications
The instructions of the assignment were very detailed and effective for understanding, especially with the provided function calls and their expected behavior. The biggest challenge that I faced for familiarizing myself with the undermining information to understand the purpose of the application. Although the external resources were good, I still had to explore additional material for error handling. Additionally, resources on how to write a good ReadMe would be nice for this assignment as well as easier ones (example resource: https://www.makeareadme.com/).

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first
to discuss what you would like to change.

The most prominent way would be with the addition of test files.
